## Release history

### v2.0.0

**Changed**

- renamed `Move` class to `Actions`
- renamed `choices.move` property to `choices.actions`

**Removed**

- removed `.enable` and `.disable` prototype methods from both `Choice` and `Choices`. These methods were ambiguous as they blurred the distinction between "enabling" a choice (meaning that it's "checked") versus enabling a property on a choice. If this is confusing, that's why they were removed. 

**Added**

- adds `Actions` class (previously named `Move`) for managing actions on choices
- adds `.addChoice` prototype method, for adding a single choice after instantiation
- adds `.action` prototype method to `Choices`, which calls a method on the `Actions` class
- adds `.check` and `.uncheck` prototype methods (previously ambiguously named `.enable` and `.disable`)

## Attribution

Some of the code in this library was initially based on the `Choices` class in Inquirer.
